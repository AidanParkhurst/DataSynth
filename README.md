# Model Synth (Working Name)

This is a **nocode, ML model generation tool**! Our frontend is made in **Sveltekit**

## Install & Running
To get started with the project, `git clone` this repository, then cd into the created folder and run `npm install`.

After that's done, you can run at any time using `npm run dev`, and connecting via your browser to the link it outputs.

If you want to test the web app on mobile, connect to the same wifi as your phone (or in the case of public wifi, connect to your phone's hotspot), and run `npm run dev -- --host` (note there are two sets of `--`), which will provide an exposed address to connect from any device.

## Getting Setup
Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the file structure. The `routes` folder contains all our pages.

Under the `(app)` folder, you will find all the routes for our web application.

Under the `(marketing)` folder, you will find all the routes for our landing page.
