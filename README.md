# Data Synth (Working Name)

This is a **synthetic data generation tool** powered by AI! It's created using **Sveltekit**

## Setup & Running
To get started with the project, `git clone` this repository, then cd into the created folder and run `npm install`.

After that's done, you can run at any time using `npm run dev`, and connecting via your browser to the link it outputs.

If you want to test the web app on mobile, connect to the same wifi as your phone (or in the case of public wifi, connect to your phone's hotspot), and run `npm run dev -- --host`, which will provide an exposed address to connect from any device.
